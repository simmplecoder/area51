Every function, class, or any other code should get through here before being merging into master branch. There are three main attributes that should be in green:
 - Conformance
 - Tests
 - Documentation
 
##sliding_window

 - <h4>Conformance: <font color=green>possible full</font> </h4>
 
 Conformance is slightly severed here, because templates created some restrictions
 
 - <h4> Tests: <font color=red>very poor tests</font></h4>
 
 There is a test or two, but all of them are premade and non randomized, so the code might be silently hiding bugds inside.
 
 - <h4> Documentation: <font color=yellow>average</font></h4>
 
 Documentation is present and covers the main parts of the code. It could use an example or two.

##Future plans

Document everything in this project, write tests and make all of them pass.
