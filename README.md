The repository is a staging ground for the Sunrise library. All of the code in Sunrise first goes through this place where it gets considerably tested and documented.

The library uses [this doxygen bootstrapper](https://github.com/Velron/doxygen-bootstrapped) to generate documentation. The license is included in `doxygen-assets` folder.
